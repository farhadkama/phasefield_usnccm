# The Phase-Field Approach to Brittle Fracture: Theory and Numerical Implementation

## 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics - Short Course

Welcome to the companion repository for the short course **"The Phase-Field Approach to Brittle Fracture: Theory and Numerical Implementation"** presented at the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics.


## Repository Contents

### Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains two primary Jupyter notebook files that demonstrate single edge notch test simulations:

1. **AT1 Model Implementation**
2. **Phase-Field Model Implementation**

Both notebooks are designed to:
- Run seamlessly in Google Colab (as demonstrated in the course)
- Execute in local Jupyter environments
- Provide step-by-step implementation guidance
- Include detailed comments and explanations

### Installation Guide

**📁 [`installation-guide/FEniCSx_Installation_Guide.pdf`](installation-guide/FEniCSx_Installation_Guide.pdf)**

A comprehensive installation guide covering:
- FEniCSx installation on Windows 11 using Docker
- FEniCSx installation on macOS using Conda


> **Note:** You do **NOT** need to install FEniCSx to run the Jupyter notebook files in this repository. The notebooks are designed to work directly in Google Colab with all dependencies pre-configured. However, you may need this installation guide if you want to run FEniCSx simulations on your personal laptop or computer for future projects.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Click on the notebook files in this repository
2. Select "Open in Colab" 
3. Follow the in-notebook setup instructions
4. Run cells sequentially

### Option 2: Local Installation
1. Follow the appropriate installation guide for your operating system
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/farhadkama/[phasefield_usnccm]`
3. Navigate to the repository directory
4. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open and run the desired notebook
